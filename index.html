		<h3> Ho Chi Minh City </h3>
		<img align="right" src="images/pic3.jpg" height="466.0" width="700"> 
		<p>Ho Chi Minh City (commonly known as Saigon) is a city in southern Vietnam famous for the pivotal role it played in the Vietnam War. It's also known for its French colonial landmarks, including Notre-Dame Cathedral, made entirely of materials imported from France, and the 19th-century Central Post Office. Food stalls line the cityâ€™s streets, especially around bustling Ben Thanh Market.</p>

		<h4> For Leisure </h4>
		<img class="img" src="images/pic.jpg" height="466.4" width="310">
		<p> One of the things that Vietnamese do is casually sit at a coffee shop and drink their coffee for hours. I bet your Starbucks barista won't mind, it's part of the culture ;) </p>

		<h4> Hungry? </h4>

		<p> What makes Vietnamese food so special? You can't un-smell the fresh herbs and pungent fish sauce in just about every dish. Each dish could really have its own bottled fragrance. </p>

		<h3> Hanoi </h3>
		<img align="right" src="images/pic2.jpg" height="466" width="700"> 
		<p>Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is known for its centuries-old architecture and a rich culture with Southeast Asian, Chinese and French influences. At its heart is the chaotic Old Quarter, where the narrow streets are roughly arranged by trade. There are many little temples, including Bach Ma, honoring a legendary horse, plus Dong Xuan Market, selling household goods and street food.</p>

	<p style="color:#59EBFC;"><b> Let's explore some of Vietnam's delicacies! </b></p>	

	<div class="sub">
		<h4> Pho </h4>
		<img class="img" src="images/pic5.jpg" width="735"> 
		<p> Pho is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, rice noodles called banh pho, a few herbs, and meat, primarily made with either beef or chicken. Pho is a popular street food in Vietnam and the specialty of a number of restaurant chains around the world. </p>

	<div class="sub2">
		<h5> Process of Making Pho </h5>
		<img class="img" src="images/pic6.jpg" height="466" width="700"> 
		<p> The broth for beef pho is generally made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones may still have beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. A smile also adds to the flavor :D </p>
